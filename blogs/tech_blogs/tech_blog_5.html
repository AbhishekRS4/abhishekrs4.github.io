                Tech Blog: Deploying an AWS Lambda function in Python for a machine learning model
              </heading>
              <br>
              <span> Posted by <strong>Abhishek R. S.</strong> on <strong>2024-07-04</strong></span>

              <!-- General info about the project -->
              <h3>The blog is about...</h3>
              <p>
                Creating a serverless deployment using AWS Lamdba function in Python for serving a machine learning model. The project can be 
                found in the following Github repo
                <a href="https://github.com/AbhishekRS4/ML_NY_Taxi/aws_lambda_func"> ML_NY_TAXI/aws_lambda_func </a>.
              </p>

              <!-- Some specific info about the project -->
              <h3>1.1) Creating a lambda function script in Python</h3>
              <p>
                A lambda function can be created in Python very easily. Refer to the project repo.
                A function named <code>lambda_handler</code> which takes an <code>event</code> as the argument returns a prediction inside a dict.
                To test the lambda function locally, run the script named <code>test_lambda_func.py</code>. Once the sanity check for the 
                working of the lambda function script is performed, it is ready to be containerized with docker.
              </p>

              <h3>1.2) IAM setup </h3>
              <p>
                Although, this is out of the scope of this blogpost, it is a standard practice to setup IAM users, groups and roles.
                Create an AWS user if not present already. Create a group for AWS Lambda users, API Gateway admin, ECR users. 
                Add user to these groups. Add policy to these groups by giving full access to relevant things. 
                Create a role for lambda with full access to lambda.
              </p>

              <h3>1.3) Creating a docker image for the lambda function and testing it locally</h3>
              <p>
                A list of publicly available docker images for AWS can be found in 
                <a href="https://gallery.ecr.aws/">Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) public gallery</a>.
                One can search for "lambda python" and find a docker image for appropriate python version under <strong>Image tags</strong>.
                This image can be used as a base docker image to build a custom docker image for a lambda function.
              </p>

              <p>
                Unlike a typical <code>Dockerfile</code>, there will be certain changes.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      There is no need to set working directory using <code>WORKDIR /app</code>
                      that is usually done in case of dockerizing a Flask / FastAPI application.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      There is no need to expose a port for docekrizing the lambda function, 
                      that is usually done in case of dockerizing a Flask / FastAPI application.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The final <code>CMD</code> to run an application inside the container will just be the 
                      <br>
                      <code>lambda_function_script:lambda_function_handler</code>
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                To build the docker container, use the following command,
                <br>
                <code>docker build -t aws-lambda-ny-taxi .</code>
              </p>

              <p>
                To test the docker container locally, run the following command,
                <br>
                <code>docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 aws-lambda-ny-taxi:latest</code>
                <br>
                followed by the test script named <code>test_lambda_func_local.py</code>
              </p>

              <h3>1.4) Creating a repo for docker container on AWS ECR</h3>
              <p>
                Create a private repo for the docker container using the following steps.
                ECR -> Create repo -> Select private -> Choose a name for the repo -> Create repo
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the repo is created, go to the repo on AWS, see <code>View Push Commands</code>. Run all the commands in the terminal.
              </p>

              <h3>1.5) Setting up the Lambda function on AWS</h3>
              <p>
                The AWS Lambda function needs to be set up. This can be done using the following steps.
                Lambda -> Create function -> Select from container image -> Choose a name for the lambda function -> 
                Choose the container image with browse images -> Choose x86_64 -> Choose existing role and select appropriate role -> Create
              </p>

              <p>
                One can easily test the lambda function using the test option. Copy paste the json input and then test. 
                Doing this directly will result in a failure since it will timeout (default timeout is 3 sec.). 
                Set a higher timeout like 30 sec. (for initial loading) and a slightly higher memory in Configuration -> General -> Timeout.
                After applying the above changes and test it, things will work. The first time will take a longer time to run (like > 20 sec.) and 
                the subsequent runs will be much faster (in milli sec.). The following image shows the successful test of the lambda function.
              </p>

                <img src="../../assets/images/tech_blogs/blog_5/lambda_test_success.png" width="100%">
              </div>

              <h3>1.6) Exposing the AWS Lambda function using AWS API Gateway</h3>
              <p>
                A Rest API needs to be created for exposing the Lambda function. This can be done using the following steps.
                API Gateway -> Rest API -> Choose a name for the API -> Create API
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the API is created, a resource needs to be created. This can be done by create resource and choose the name of the resource (/predict).
              </p>
              <p>
                Create a method to invoke the resource using the following steps. 
                Create method -> Select method type (POST) -> Choose as Lambda function -> Select the appropriate lambda function -> Create method
                The API can be tested using Test. Copy paste the json to the request body and test. The first time will take a longer time to run (>2 sec.).
                The subsequent runs will take much less time (in milli sec.). The following image shows the successful test 
                of the deployed API using the AWS API gateway.
              </p>
              <div class="featured-image">
                <img src="../../assets/images/tech_blogs/blog_5/deployed_api_success.png" width="100%">
              </div>
              <p>
                After all these steps, one can deploy the API using Deploy API -> select new stage -> choose a stage name (test)
                Use the invoke URL in <code>test_lambda_func_aws.py</code> script to acutally send POST request to the API deployed on AWS.
              </p>

              <h3>1.7) Challenges faced</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    I forgot to remove the <code>WORKDIR /app</code> from the Dockerfile for the lambda function and got some errors 
                    that the script <code>lambda_function.py</code> was not found. I figured it out later and removed <code>WORKDIR /app</code>.
                    This is because of the fact that AWS is providing the base docker image and they would have built it with their own config.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Another mistake that I made was that number of arguments for any lambda function <code>lambda_handler()</code> is two and 
                    it will require event and context as arguments. I initially used only one as I was still learning and experimenting. I got
                    some error regarding mismatch in the number of function args. After fixing this, things worked smoothly.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
